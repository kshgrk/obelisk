# Obelisk Temporal Integration PRD

## Overview
Transform the existing Obelisk FastAPI chat server from a simple request-response architecture to a robust, fault-tolerant system powered by Temporal workflow orchestration. This integration will enhance the chat server's reliability, scalability, and enable advanced features like conversation lifecycle management, message processing pipelines, and distributed session handling.

The current system handles chat sessions and messages directly through FastAPI endpoints with immediate SQLite database operations. The enhanced system will orchestrate these operations through Temporal workflows, providing durability, retry logic, monitoring, and the foundation for advanced conversational AI features.

## Core Features

### 1. Temporal Workflow Architecture
- **Chat Session Workflows**: Long-running workflows that manage the entire lifecycle of a chat session from creation to cleanup
- **Message Processing Workflows**: Short-running workflows that handle individual message processing with retry logic and error handling
- **Session Lifecycle Management**: Automated session cleanup, archival, and maintenance through scheduled workflows
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Replace direct database calls with workflow-orchestrated activities for better reliability

### 2. Enhanced Message Processing Pipeline
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute database operations and OpenRouter API calls concurrently through Temporal activities
- **Retry Strategies**: Implement sophisticated retry logic for API failures, database errors, and network issues
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms with dead letter queues for failed operations
- **Message Validation**: Pre-processing validation and sanitization through dedicated activities

### 3. Distributed Session Management
- **Session State Persistence**: Leverage Temporal's durable execution for session state management
- **Context Management**: Enhanced conversation context handling with configurable history limits
- **Session Metrics**: Real-time session analytics and performance monitoring through workflow signals
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations for session cleanup and data maintenance

### 4. Monitoring and Observability
- **Temporal Dashboard Integration**: Full visibility into workflow execution, failures, and performance
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific metrics for chat performance, user engagement, and system health
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerts for workflow failures, high latency, and system anomalies
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all chat operations and administrative actions

### 5. Advanced Features Foundation
- **Conversation Analytics**: Framework for analyzing conversation patterns and user behavior
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Architecture for supporting multiple isolated chat environments
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for adding new conversation processing capabilities
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking background tasks for content moderation, analytics, and maintenance

## User Experience

### Primary Personas
- **End Users**: Chat application users expecting fast, reliable responses with session continuity
- **Developers**: System maintainers requiring observability, debugging capabilities, and easy deployment
- **Operations Team**: Infrastructure managers needing monitoring, alerting, and performance insights

### Key User Flows
1. **Chat Session Creation**
   - User initiates new chat → Workflow creates session → Database persistence → Session ID returned
   - Enhanced with automatic session configuration and pre-loading of conversation context

2. **Message Exchange**
   - User sends message → Workflow processes message → Parallel execution of context retrieval and API call → Response generation → Database persistence → Streaming response delivery
   - Improved reliability with automatic retries and fallback mechanisms

3. **Session Management**
   - Background workflows automatically clean up inactive sessions
   - Configurable retention policies and archival strategies
   - Real-time session metrics and health monitoring

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Automatic retry of failed operations with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
   - User-friendly error messages with operation status tracking

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
1. **FastAPI Server**: Maintains existing API endpoints but delegates processing to Temporal workflows
2. **Temporal Workers**: Dedicated worker processes for different types of operations (chat, session management, background tasks)
3. **Workflow Definitions**: Python-based workflow definitions for all chat operations
4. **Activity Implementations**: Granular activities for database operations, API calls, and business logic
5. **Database Layer**: Enhanced SQLite integration with connection pooling and transaction management
6. **Monitoring Stack**: Temporal UI integration with custom dashboards and metrics

### Data Models
- **Enhanced Session Model**: Additional fields for workflow tracking, metrics, and lifecycle state
- **Message Model**: Extended with processing status, retry count, and workflow correlation IDs
- **Workflow State**: New tables for tracking workflow execution and custom metrics
- **Configuration Model**: Runtime configuration for workflow parameters and system settings

### APIs and Integrations
- **Existing FastAPI Endpoints**: Maintained for backward compatibility, internally delegating to workflows
- **Temporal Client Integration**: Connection management and workflow invocation from FastAPI
- **OpenRouter API**: Enhanced with circuit breaker patterns and comprehensive error handling
- **Database Operations**: Transactional operations with proper isolation and consistency guarantees

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose setup for Temporal server, workers, and dependencies
- **Production Environment**: Scalable Temporal cluster with proper monitoring and backup strategies
- **Database**: Enhanced SQLite configuration with WAL mode and connection pooling
